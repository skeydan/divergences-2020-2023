A few years ago, I wanted to learn about, and maybe, try to make up my mind, about a topic I -- surprisingly -- never had given much thought to, before: consciousness. After reading a few books (first and foremost, Blackmore & Troscianko's *Consciousness: An Introduction*, which I liked a lot), I certainly had *not* made up my mind; all I knew was that I certainly would not want to be a dualist; that the dominant neuroscientific theories felt simplistic; that I wasn't convinced all we need is quantum physics; and that Daniel Dennett's tbd rhymed most with my views. Like in Kurosawa's Rashomon, we'd be confronted with a set of parallel narratives; only here, I wasn't too sure they were even trying to tell the same story.

In most cases, though, at least I got an impression of the kind of story they wanted to tell. With one exception. Before I came across Blackmore & Troscianko, I did the naheliegend thing: look up "consciousness" in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. And there they were: the mysterious *qualia* (tbd footnote). Perception, in my view, is incredibly interesting, and it is something we know a lot about, on various levels. But that question: What is it like to see "red"? What is it like to *see*? Well, what does it matter? The whole topic of qualia seemed utterly unimportant.

### Unscared

But that is not something you say, is it? When centuries of philosophical tradition say otherwise.

Now comes Mark Solms and, based on a solid foundation of brain science research, does away with it all in one sweep.

Unscared of ... Solms argues with what I can't call anything else but *common sense*. Just like other modes of perception, vision works without consciousness, without us being aware. It does not matter what I "feel" when I see red; all that matters is that I react in a adequate way. (Depending on what environment I'm in, the correct thing to do may be to pick the raspberry or stop in front of the traffic light; but in neither case would it be fruitful for me to ponder the item's redness.)

What I *feel* when ... : In that sentence, the magic has made its appearance. This is the narrative, the intrepid narrative, Solms is telling: *Consciousness* equals *awareness* equals *feeling*.

Why?

The first equality, between consciousness and awareness, is not that "far-fetched", from a more mainstream mix of views. And the essential thing about feelings is that their whole point is to be aware of them! For Solms, feelings don't start with the dramatic, the intricate or the sublime; hunger is a feeling, being hypothermic is, of different type but comparable function as the primary emotions fear, rage, panic/sadness, seeking, play, and care (tbd footnote Panksepp). What all feelings have in common is that they guide our behavior: With "primitive" emotions such as thirst and freezing, the behavior they induce may be directly related to survival, "higher" emotions help in, as Solms nicely puts it, "feeling our way" through the vast (otherwise) space of behavioral options opening up at any moment.

So this is the straightforward argumentation: How can a feeling help guide me if I'm not aware of it? The hunger I don't feel won't make me eat.

This is, it seems to me, the first great achievement of Solms' common sense: Forget about the redness of red and the blueness of blue, instead picture how it feels to be feeling. I feel, therefore I'm conscious.

The second achievement of common sense, however, is why I'm writing this text, and it is of much greater importance. Before we get to it, one last remark.

Above, I was already suggesting that with the topic of consciousness, we may sometimes feel like we're lost in a cobweb of narratives, with different nodes in that graph more or less densely connected, more or less compatible, more or less sharing a common language. And really it seems to me, now, that this is largely a matter of language; of the phrases we use, the economies of brain effort we derive by following the trodden paths of learned linguistic habits. When Solms challenges the neocortex-centric, analytic, higher-order, reflective view of consciousness, he does not just fight against the very solid windmills of anthropocentrism (the next thing I'll be talking about). He also has to counteract the effects of highly established, utterly present-in-our-minds expressions like "stream of consciousness". In fact, when first making my way through Blackmore & Troscianko's labyrinth of viewpoints, I found myself trying to relate those to familiar concepts like these. Maybe more than people who are capable of visual imagination, those who don't -- those with aphantasia, who can't "see" anything "in their mind's eye" -- have a mind's *ear*, and keep telling themselves stories about what they experience. Those stories, be they more like comments or like dissections, seem to suggest that consciousness is "meta", is "on top of", is more than what really there is.

Now, to where common sense gets revolutionary.

### The next Copernican (and desperately needed!) turn

Without further ado, let me spell it out. There are kids, born without a cortex (footnote), who may look like they enjoy things, have fun, feel happy about something. (Probably they also feel bad, sometimes, but these are not the situations Solms relates.) If they look like they enjoy, and joy is a feeling, why would we doubt that they feel something? Isn't this common sense, as well: If someone, a person, (let me go farther already), a being looks like they sense, feel, experience, what valid reason do we have to claim they're just *looking it*?

Concretely, what Solms says is that at least all mammals, but to different degrees, also other families?? share the brain structures associated with feeling. Various degrees: There is no on-off, no conscious-yes-or-no. If your cat purrs as you stroke her, would you assume she doesn't have fun? If I see a crow monitoring the grasslands, should I think there's no intent, no purpose? If the flower aligns itself with the sun --

We don't know. All we can surmise is that there is a continuum, of intent, of experience, of feeling. Maybe there also is an other-ness, something we don't have concepts for. In any case, what follows from this is that we have no right to impose ourselves on nature, the way we've been doing for millennia. Not only is there no creation, -- man (or woman) certainly is not its culmination.

And this is why I would like to write: Everyone should read this book. It is time, high time, for the next Copernican revolution, after the planetary one and the evolutionary one. We could call the revolution of neuroscience, grounded as it is in brain science results, but I'd rather stay with what makes me think it's so over-due: the revolution of common sense.

### A necessary remark, and two quick comments

Before I end, I want to make sure I haven't, in this text, provoked a misunderstanding that might keep you from reading this book. I am not a neuroscientist, and in this write-up, I have distilled what in my view is the book's main message. But this is not a book of groundless opinions, and even less, one of politics or zealotism. The (subcortical) structures that create consciousness *do* have names; the book has 100? pages of end notes linking to studies underpinning the conclusions drawn. But in the end, and his formulations are so clear that I think Solms himself would confirm this -- in the end, this is a matter of
