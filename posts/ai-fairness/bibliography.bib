abstract = {In this paper, we present a deep learning based approach to assign POS tags to words
in a piece of text given to it as input. We propose an unsupervised approach owing
to the lack of a large Sanskrit annotated corpora and use the untagged Sanskrit Corpus
prepared by JNU for our purpose. The only tagged corpora for Sanskrit is created by
JNU which has 115,000 words which are not sufficient to apply supervised deep learning
approaches. For the tag assignment purpose and determining model accuracy, we utilize
this tagged corpus. We explore various methods through which each Sanskrit word can
be represented as a point multi-dimensional vector space whose position accurately
captures its meaning and semantic information associated with it. We also explore
other data sources to improve performance and robustness of the vector representations.
We use these rich vector representations and explore autoencoder based approaches
for dimensionality reduction to compress these into encodings which are suitable for
clustering in the vector space. We experiment with different dimensions of these compressed
representations and present one which was found to offer the best clustering performance.
For modelling the sequence in order to preserve the semantic information we feed these
embeddings to a bidirectional LSTM autoencoder. We assign a POS tag to each of the
obtained clusters and produce our result by testing the model on the tagged corpus.},
