abstract = {Until recently, long-range forecast systems showed only modest levels of skill in predicting surface winter climate around the Atlantic Basin and associated fluctuations in the North Atlantic Oscillation at seasonal lead times. Here we use a new forecast system to assess seasonal predictability of winter North Atlantic climate. We demonstrate that key aspects of European and North American winter climate and the surface North Atlantic Oscillation are highly predictable months ahead. We demonstrate high levels of prediction skill in retrospective forecasts of the surface North Atlantic Oscillation, winter storminess, near-surface temperature, and wind speed, all of which have high value for planning and adaptation to extreme winter conditions. Analysis of forecast ensembles suggests that while useful levels of seasonal forecast skill have now been achieved, key sources of predictability are still only partially represented and there is further untapped predictability.},

  abstract = {A practical step-by-step guide to wavelet analysis is given, with
	examples taken from time series of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation
	(ENSO). The guide includes a comparison to the windowed Fourier transform,
	the choice of an appropriate wavelet basis function, edge effects
	due to finite-length time series, and the relationship between wavelet
	scale and Fourier frequency. New statistical significance tests for
	wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theoretical wavelet
	spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish
	significance levels and confidence intervals. It is shown that smoothing
	in time or scale can be used to increase the confidence of the wavelet
	spectrum. Empirical formulas are given for the effect of smoothing
	on significance levels and confidence intervals. Extensions to wavelet
	analysis such as filtering, the power Hovmoller, cross-wavelet spectra,
	and coherence are described. The statistical significance tests are
	used to give a quantitative measure of changes in ENSO variance on
	interdecadal timescales. Using new datasets that extend back to 1871,
	the Nino3 sea surface temperature and the Southern Oscillation index
	show significantly higher power during 1880-1920 and 1960-90, and
	lower power during 1920-60, as well as a possible 15-yr modulation
	of variance. The power Hovmoller of sea level pressure shows significant
	variations in 2-8-yr wavelet power in both longitude and time.},
