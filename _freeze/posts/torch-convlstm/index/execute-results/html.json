At the same time, we'd like to efficiently extract spatial features, something that is normally done with convolutional filters. Ideally then, we'd have at our disposal an architecture that is both recurrent and convolutional. In this post, we build a convolutional LSTM with torch.\n---\n\n\n\n\nThis post is the first in a loose series exploring forecasting of spatially-determined data over time. By spatially-determined I mean that whatever the quantities we're trying to predict -- be they univariate or multivariate time series, of spatial dimensionality or not -- the *input* data are given on a spatial grid.\n\nFor example, the input could be atmospheric measurements, such as sea surface temperature or pressure, given at some set of latitudes and longitudes. The target to be predicted could then span that same (or another) grid. Alternatively, it could be a univariate time series, like a meteorological index.\n\nBut wait a second, you may be thinking. For time-series prediction, we have that time-honored set of recurrent architectures (e.g., LSTM, GRU), right? Right. We do; but, once we feed spatial data to an RNN, treating different locations as different input features, we lose an essential structural relationship. Importantly, we need to operate in both space and time. We want both: recurrence relations and convolutional filters. Enter *convolutional RNNs*.\n\n## What to expect from this post\n\nToday, we won't jump into real-world applications just yet. Instead, we'll take our time to build a convolutional LSTM (henceforth: convLSTM) in `torch`. For one, we have to -- there is no official PyTorch implementation.\n\n(Keras, on the other hand, has one. If you're interested in quickly playing around with a Keras convLSTM, check out [this nice example](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/guide/keras/examples/conv_lstm/).)\n\nWhat's more, this post can serve as an introduction to building your own modules. This is something you may be familiar with from Keras or not -- depending on whether you've used custom models or rather, preferred the declarative *define -\\> compile -\\> fit* style. (Yes, I'm implying there's some transfer going on if one comes to `torch` from Keras custom training. Syntactic and semantic details may be different, but both share the object-oriented style that allows for great flexibility and control.)\n\nLast but not least, we'll also use this as a hands-on experience with RNN architectures (the LSTM, specifically). While the general concept of recurrence may be easy to grasp, it is not necessarily self-evident how those architectures should, or could, be coded. Personally, I find that independent of the framework used, RNN-related documentation leaves me confused. What exactly *is* being returned from calling an LSTM, or a GRU? (In Keras this depends on how you've defined the layer in question.) I suspect that once we've decided what we *want* to return, the actual code won't be that complicated. Consequently, we'll take a detour clarifying what it is that `torch` and Keras are giving us. Implementing our convLSTM will be a lot more straightforward thereafter.\n\n## A `torch` convLSTM\n\nThe code discussed here may be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/skeydan/convlstm). (Depending on when you're reading this, the code in that repository may have evolved though.)\n\nMy starting point was one of the PyTorch implementations found on the net, namely, [this one](https://github.com/ndrplz/ConvLSTM_pytorch/blob/master/convlstm.py). If you search for \"PyTorch convGRU\" or \"PyTorch convLSTM\", you will find stunning discrepancies in how these are realized -- discrepancies not just in syntax and/or engineering ambition, but on the semantic level, right at the center of what the architectures may be expected to do. As they say, let the buyer beware. (Regarding the implementation I ended up porting, I am confident that while numerous optimizations will be possible, the basic mechanism matches my expectations.)\n\nWhat do I expect? Let's approach this task in a top-down way.\n\n### Input and output\n\nThe convLSTM's input will be a time series of spatial data, each observation being of size `(time steps, channels, height, width)`.\n\nCompare this with the usual RNN input format, be it in `torch` or Keras. In both frameworks, RNNs expect tensors of size `(timesteps, input_dim)`[^1]. `input_dim` is $1$ for univariate time series and greater than $1$ for multivariate ones. Conceptually, we may match this to convLSTM's `channels` dimension: There could be a single channel, for temperature, say -- or there could be several, such as for pressure, temperature, and humidity. The two additional dimensions found in convLSTM, `height` and `width`, are spatial indexes into the data.\n\n[^1]: Leaving aside the batch dimension in this discussion.\n\nIn sum, we want to be able to pass data that:\n\n-   consist of one or more features,\n\n-   evolve in time, and\n\n-   are indexed in two spatial dimensions.\n\nHow about the output? We want to be able to return forecasts for as many time steps as we have in the input sequence. This is something that `torch` RNNs do by default, while Keras equivalents do not. (You have to pass `return_sequences = TRUE` to obtain that effect.) If we're interested in predictions for just a single point in time, we can always pick the last time step in the output tensor.\n\nHowever, with RNNs, it is not all about outputs. RNN architectures also carry through hidden states.\n\nWhat are hidden states? I carefully phrased that sentence to be as general as possible -- deliberately circling around the confusion that, in my view, often arises at this point. We'll attempt to clear up some of that confusion in a second, but let's first finish our high-level requirements specification.\n\nWe want our convLSTM to be usable in different contexts and applications. Various architectures exist that make use of hidden states, most prominently perhaps, encoder-decoder architectures. Thus, we want our convLSTM to return those as well. Again, this is something a `torch` LSTM does by default, while in Keras it is achieved using `return_state = TRUE`.\n\nNow though, it really is time for that interlude. We'll sort out the ways things are called by both `torch` and Keras, and inspect what you get back from their respective GRUs and LSTMs.\n\n### Interlude: Outputs, states, hidden values ... what's what?\n\nFor this to remain an interlude, I summarize findings on a high level. The code snippets in the appendix show how to arrive at these results. Heavily commented, they probe return values from both Keras and `torch` GRUs and LSTMs. Running these will make the upcoming summaries seem a lot less abstract.\n\nFirst, let's look at the ways you create an LSTM in both frameworks. (I will generally use LSTM as the \"prototypical RNN example\", and just mention GRUs when there are differences significant in the context in question.)\n\nIn Keras, to create an LSTM you may write something like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlstm <- layer_lstm(units = 1)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `torch` equivalent would be:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlstm <- nn_lstm(\n  input_size = 2, # number of input features\n  hidden_size = 1 # number of hidden (and output!) features\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nDon't focus on `torch`'s `input_size` parameter for this discussion. (It's the number of features in the input tensor.) The parallel occurs between Keras' `units` and `torch`'s `hidden_size`. If you've been using Keras, you're probably thinking of `units` as the thing that determines output size (equivalently, the number of features in the output). So when `torch` lets us arrive at the same result using `hidden_size`, what does that mean? It means that somehow we're specifying the same thing, using different terminology. And it does make sense, since at every time step current input and previous hidden state are added[^2]:\n\n[^2]: In theory, it would be possible for them to be of different sizes if the respective weight matrices transformed their operands to the same output size.\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{h}_t = \\mathbf{W}_{x}\\mathbf{x}_t + \\mathbf{W}_{h}\\mathbf{h}_{t-1}\n$$\n\nNow, *about those hidden states*.\n\nWhen a Keras LSTM is defined with `return_state = TRUE`, its return value is a structure of three entities called output, memory state, and carry state. In `torch`, the same entities are referred to as output, hidden state, and cell state. (In `torch`, we always get all of them.)\n\nSo are we dealing with three different types of entities? We are not.\n\nThe cell, or carry state is that special thing that sets apart LSTMs from GRUs deemed responsible for the \"long\" in \"long short-term memory\". Technically, it could be reported to the user at all points in time; as we'll see shortly though, it is not.\n\nWhat about outputs and hidden, or memory states? Confusingly, these really are the same thing. Recall that for each input *item* in the input *sequence*, we're combining it with the previous state, resulting in a new state, to be made used of in the next step[^3]:\n\n[^3]: Yes, this is the same formula as above.\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{h}_t = \\mathbf{W}_{x}\\mathbf{x}_t + \\mathbf{W}_{h}\\mathbf{h}_{t-1}\n$$\n\nNow, say that we're interested in looking at just the final time step -- that is, the default output of a Keras LSTM. From that point of view, we can consider those intermediate computations as \"hidden\". Seen like that, output and hidden states feel different.\n\nHowever, we can also request to see the outputs for every time step. If we do so, there is no difference -- the output**s** (plural) equal the hidden states. This can be verified using the code in the appendix.\n\nThus, of the three things returned by an LSTM, two are really the same. How about the GRU, then? As there is no \"cell state\", we really have just one type of thing left over -- call it outputs or hidden states.\n\nLet's summarize this in a table.\n\n<br />\n\n::: {.l-page}\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------+--------------+\n| Referring to this entity:                                                                                                          | `torch` says: | Keras says:  |\n+====================================================================================================================================+===============+==============+\n| *Number of features in the output*                                                                                                 | `hidden_size` | `units`      |\n|                                                                                                                                    |               |              |\n| This determines both how many output features there are *and* the dimensionality of the hidden states.                             |               |              |\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------+--------------+\n| *Per-time-step output; latent state; intermediate state ...*                                                                       | hidden state  | memory state |\n|                                                                                                                                    |               |              |\n| This could be named \"public state\" in the sense that we, the users, are able to obtain *all values.*                               |               |              |\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------+--------------+\n| *Cell state; inner state ...

Comparing torch-speak and Keras-speak. In row 1, the terms are parameter names. In rows 2 and 3, they are pulled from current documentation.\n:::\n\n<br />\n\nNow, about that public vs. private distinction. In both frameworks, we can obtain outputs (hidden states) for every time step. The cell state, however, we can access only for the very last time step. This is purely an implementation decision. As we'll see when building our own recurrent module, there are no obstacles inherent in keeping track of cell states and passing them back to the user.\n\nIf you dislike the pragmatism of this distinction, you can always go with the math. When a new cell state has been computed (based on prior cell state, input, forget, and cell gates -- the specifics of which we are not going to get into here), it is transformed to the hidden (a.k.a. output) state making use of yet another, namely, the output gate:\n\n$$\nh_t = o_t \\odot \\tanh(c_t)\n$$\n\nDefinitely, then, hidden state (output, resp.) builds on cell state, adding additional modeling power.\n\nNow it is time to get back to our original goal and build that convLSTM.

Cf. the appendix for complete examples.\n:::\n\n<br />\n\n### `convLSTM`, the plan\n\nIn both `torch` and Keras RNN architectures, single time steps are processed by corresponding `Cell` classes: There is an LSTM Cell matching the LSTM, a GRU Cell matching the GRU, and so on. We do the same for ConvLSTM. In `convlstm_cell()`, we first define what should happen to a single observation; then in `convlstm()`, we build up the recurrence logic.\n\nOnce we're done, we create a dummy dataset, as reduced-to-the-essentials as can be. With more complex datasets, even artificial ones, chances are that if we don't see any training progress, there are hundreds of possible explanations. We want a sanity check that, if failed, leaves no excuses. Realistic applications are left to future posts.\n\n### A single step: `convlstm_cell`\n\nOur `convlstm_cell`'s constructor takes arguments `input_dim` , `hidden_dim`, and `bias`, just like a `torch` LSTM Cell.\n\nBut we're processing two-dimensional input data. Instead of the usual affine combination of new input and previous state, we use a convolution of kernel size `kernel_size`. Inside `convlstm_cell`, it is `self$conv` that takes care of this.\n\nNote how the `channels` dimension, which in the original input data would correspond to different variables, is creatively used to consolidate four convolutions into one: Each channel output will be passed to just one of the four cell gates. Once in possession of the convolution output, `forward()` applies the gate logic, resulting in the two types of states it needs to send back to the caller.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(torch)\nlibrary(zeallot)\n\nconvlstm_cell <- nn_module(\n  \n  initialize = function(input_dim, hidden_dim, kernel_size, bias) {\n    \n    self$hidden_dim <- hidden_dim\n    \n    padding <- kernel_size %/% 2\n    \n    self$conv <- nn_conv2d(\n      in_channels = input_dim + self$hidden_dim,\n      # for each of input, forget, output, and cell gates\n      out_channels = 4 * self$hidden_dim,\n      kernel_size = kernel_size,\n      padding = padding,\n      bias = bias\n    )\n  },\n  \n  forward = function(x, prev_states) {\n\n    c(h_prev, c_prev) %<-% prev_states\n    \n    combined <- torch_cat(list(x, h_prev), dim = 2)  # concatenate along channel axis\n    combined_conv <- self$conv(combined)\n    c(cc_i, cc_f, cc_o, cc_g) %<-% torch_split(combined_conv, self$hidden_dim, dim = 2)\n    \n    # input, forget, output, and cell gates (corresponding to torch's LSTM)\n    i <- torch_sigmoid(cc_i)\n    f <- torch_sigmoid(cc_f)\n    o <- torch_sigmoid(cc_o)\n    g <- torch_tanh(cc_g)\n    \n    # cell state\n    c_next <- f * c_prev + i * g\n    # hidden state\n    h_next <- o * torch_tanh(c_next)\n    \n    list(h_next, c_next)\n  },\n  \n  init_hidden = function(batch_size, height, width) {\n    \n    list(\n      torch_zeros(batch_size, self$hidden_dim, height, width, device = self$conv$weight$device),\n      torch_zeros(batch_size, self$hidden_dim, height, width, device = self$conv$weight$device))\n  }\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow `convlstm_cell` has to be called for every time step. This is done by `convlstm`.\n\n### Iteration over time steps: `convlstm`\n\nA `convlstm` may consist of several layers, just like a `torch` LSTM. For each layer, we are able to specify hidden and kernel sizes individually.\n\nDuring initialization, each layer gets its own `convlstm_cell`. On call, `convlstm` executes two loops. The outer one iterates over layers. At the end of each iteration, we store the final pair `(hidden state, cell state)` for later reporting.
